Create a budgeting app

I want to create subtools that can be used to better estimate financing.

# Gas Estimator?

Given the car model and distance travelled each day or per week. We can estimate how much gas does a person use.

# How much until...?

How much until I get a savings of $10,000 if I save $200 each month?
The idea is to give people how long until they reach their goal given their spending

# How much per week is **\_**?

Calculate how much should a person spend on an object?
Say that I have a left over of $200 per month.
If I cut that up into 30 days, I get $6.67 per day.
if I remove the weekend, it will probably be more.
